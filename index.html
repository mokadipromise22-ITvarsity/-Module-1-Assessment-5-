            <h5>THUNDER</h5>
            <p>
                Thunder, a.k.a. Anissa Pierce, is the eldest daughter of the superhero Black Lightning. But she's more
                than just a family legacy. Thunder can increase her body density at will, making her immovable and
                almost completely invulnerable. She is also bullet proof and can create shockwaves by stomping on the
                ground -- really handy when taking down bad guys. She's memorably portrayed by Nafessa Williams in the
                CW's "Black Lightning" series, where like her comics counterpart she's an out lesbian.

            <h5>SHURI</h5>
            <p>
                Sister to King T'Challa, the current Black Panther, Shuri is Wakanda's top scientist -- which makes her
                pretty much the world's top scientist. As played by Letitia Wright in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
                Shuri not only designs Black Panther's ultra-advanced tech and numerous other world-changing inventions,
                she's also a powerful warrior in her own right. Her comics counterpart, created in 2003 by Reginald
                Hudlin and John Romita Jr., is even more badass: she's been given Black Panther powers, she can
                transform into animals, and she's even managed to come back from the dead.

            <h5>OKOYE</h5>
            <p>
                Created by Christopher Priest and Mark Texeira in 1998, Okoye was long one of Marvel's lesser-known
                heroes, until she became a straight up icon thanks to Danai Gurira's performances in "Black Panther,"
                "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame."</p>
            <p>
                Okoye is the head of Black Panther's personal bodyguards, the Dora Milaj. And what she lacks in Black
                Panther's literal superpowers, she more than makes up for with martial arts expertise and a genius at
                tactical and strategic thinking. No wonder she not only went toe to toe against the children of Thanos
                and lived, she also single-handedly saved Wakanda after The Snap wiped out trillions, including Black
                Panther.

            <h5>LIGHTNING</h5>
            <p>
                Black Lightning's other daughter, Jennifer Pierce, can manipulate electricity and generate it from her
                own body, as well as fly. So don't mess with her. She's best known for being played by China Anne
                McClain on The CW's "Black Lightning," a show all of you should be watching.

            <h5>JESSICA JONES</h5>
            <p>
                Created by Brian Michael Bendis for Marvel's "Alias" comics in 2001, Jessica Jones has been a hard
                drinking expert private detective, an Avenger and even a high school classmate of Spider-Man. She's
                strong, she can fly, and she isn't here for your B.S., especially on her Netflix show, where she was
                played by Krysten Ritter.

            <h5>HARLEY QUINN</h5>
            <p>
                While formerly an absolute villain, Harley has since crossed over into a more heroic, or at least,
                non-villainous role. Introduced in the 1990s show "Batman the Animated Series," originally she was Dr.
                Harleen Quinzel, an Arkham Asylum psychiatrist manipulated by the Joker into helping him escape and
                joining his gang. After years of cruelty, she finally left him and since then DC comics stories have
                emphasized that she's an abuse survivor trying to figure out her own way in a world. Incredibly smart
                and immune to almost all toxins, she frequently teams up with fellow supervillains Catwoman and Poison
                Ivy. She's played by Margot Robbie in "Suicide Squad" and 2020's "Birds of Prey," and by Kaley Cuoco in
                DC's animated "Harley Quinn" series.

            <h5>ELEKTRA</h5>
            <p>
                Best known for being played by Jennifer Garner in 2003's "Daredevil" as well as her own standalone 2005
                film, this Marvel superheroine is an expert martial artist and assassin who has worked on both sides of
                the law (until she eventually killed the evil aspects of her personality in a duel.) She was created by
                Frank Miller in 1981.

            <h5>CAPTAIN MARVEL</h5>
            <p>
                Originally known as Ms. Marvel (a title now used by another entry on this list), Carol Danvers assumed
                the Mantle of Captain Marvel in honor of her mentor, the alien hero Mar-Vell. Created by Roy Thomas and
                Gene Colan in 1968, she's an air force pilot and feminist activist who fights supervillains as Captain
                Marvel, and sexism in her civilian guise. Played by Brie Larson in the 2018 film, Captain Marvel has
                superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and agility, and can fly faster than the speed of sound. She
                has the “Seventh Sense,” which allows her to predict future danger. She can also heal from injuries
                quickly, has immunity to toxins and poisons, and can shoot light beams from her hands.

            <h5>ELASTIGIRL</h5>
            <p>
                Not to be left out is Elastigirl from "The Incredibles." The alter ego of Helen Parr, wife of Mr.
                Incredible (Bob Parr) and mother of Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack, she can stretch any part of her body
                and mold herself into different shapes and sizes. She's voiced by Holly Hunter.

            <h5>BLACK WIDOW</h5>
            <p>
                Black Widow emerged as one of the crucial heroes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to her
                portrayal by Scarlett Johansson. Created by Stan Lee, Don Rico and Don Heck, she's a former Russian spy
                who defected to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers. In the comics, her powers include resistance to disease
                and aging, ability to suppress and replace memories, agility. In the films, she's just a run of the mill
                extreme badass, master athlete and martial artist with a talent for psychological manipulation -- and a
                great leader too. Her backstory will be fleshed out a lot more in her self-titled solo film, whose
                release is set for May 2021.

            <h5>BATWOMAN</h5>
            <p>
                Ruby Rose played the openly lesbian superhero Kate Kane, a.k.a. Batwoman, in the first season of The CW
                series "Batwoman. In the series, Kane returned to Gotham to take over for the Caped Crusader and save
                the city. For the second season, Javicia Leslie was cast as Ryan Wilder, a brand-new character (not in
                the comics) who takes on the Batwoman persona.

            <h5>THE WASP</h5>
            <p>
                More than one Marvel hero has been known as The Wasp, but the best known is Hope Van Dyne, played by
                Evangeline Lilly in "Ant-Man" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp." In both the movies and comics, she's the
                daughter of the original Ant-Man and The Wasp, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne -- though unlike her comics
                counterpart, in the movies she doesn't have innate powers. No worries though. She's a gifted strategist
                and formidable martial artist who, thanks to some pretty sophisticated technology, is also able to
                shrink to the size of an insect (with proportional strength) and fly. She can also punch really, really
                hard.
